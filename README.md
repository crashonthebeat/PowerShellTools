# PowerShellTools

A collection of custom PowerShell Modules that I use sometimes. I probably won't publish these, so feel free to use
them in your own local repos. Most of what I'll put here is just stuff I built myself because I wanted to rather than
just finding a module somewhere else.

### PSAnsiUtils

A collection of functions to help with doing ANSI escape strings for console manipulation.
